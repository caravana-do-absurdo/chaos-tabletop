## What does it do?
- Quick and easy d20, d12, d10, d8, d6 and d4 rollers. You can run as many dices as you want, all at the same time
- Logging of all dice values - So that you don't miss what were the results of the last throws
- Very simple map builder (currently under construction)

## Features currently to be implemented
- More map tiles
- Exporting, saving locally and importing maps. So that all you progress is not lost after a page refresh
- More layers to build maps, placing objects on top of tiles
- Zooming in, out and making map sizes more flexible

## Would you like to see new features?
- Feel free to open a feature request with us!
- Further support in the repo is always appreciated
